    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cheap spaghetti recipe. 2 servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 head garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (26.5 ounce) can spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) jar banana ketchup</li>
      <li>0.25 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>0.5 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
        over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and
        return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
        the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12
        minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic
        and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef and pork; season with
        salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the meat has browned. Pour in the
        spaghetti sauce, banana ketchup, sugar, and water. Simmer until the
        sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in hot dog slices and
        continue to cook until hot dogs are heated through. Serve over spaghetti
        with Cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.
