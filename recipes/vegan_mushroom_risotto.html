    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cheap, easy to make vegan mushroom risotto. 3 servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 cups vegetable stock, or more if needed</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) packages baby bella mushrooms, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour vegetable stock into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium
        heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high
        heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened,
        about 10 minutes. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5
        minutes. Stir in celery and garlic, and cook until garlic is fragrant,
        about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and Arborio rice to the Dutch
        oven. Cook, stirring often, until rice is opaque and smells slightly
        toasted, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in white wine, and cook until it
        evaporates, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Season with thyme, salt, and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin stirring in reserved warm vegetable stock, 1 cup at a time,
        allowing each addition of stock to be fully absorbed before adding in
        the next, stirring continuously. Continue adding broth gradually while
        stirring constantly, until rice is tender and creamy, about 20 minutes.
        Season with additional salt and pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
